## Short Description

### What are we facing right now?
Post-lockdown will be very risky to allow the public transportation without a properly streamlined and fine-tuned mechanism in place. Traveling without maintaining approved social distancing norms and Standard Operating Procedures of Covid19 will enhance the rate of transmission of the disease.

### Need
An Intelligent Post-Lockdown System for Public Transportation which is demand-driven and predictable.

### Our Approach
We divided the problem of Post-Covid Public transport into two; 
Before Travel (BT)and After Travel (AT). 
Before Travel (BT): 
Here in BT, we address the concerns of the user to encourage them to travel. Assurance of maintaining Covid-19 protocol for a safe, convenient and comfortable journey along with technology interventions to generate customer delight are identified as key triggers to work with. 
After Travel : 
Creating of database of passengers travelled will enable concerned authority to use it for contract tracing which is pivotal as per Covid19 protocol in many countries. 
Thus our App addresses all the major concern of covid19 related precautionary measures and thus will play a key role in bringing the economy back to its feet.

### Our Idea
An all-encompassing solution that addresses all the stake holders. That is, the user, the public transport authorities and the government. For the user, it makes the journey convenient, comfortable and safe and also encourages them to travel with pride as in a hired taxi. It addresses issues of social distancing, reducing customer touch points, and hassles of conventional travel. For the Public Transport Authorities, it encourages them to embrace an Intelligent DemandDriven, predictive architecture, that makes their business economically feasible, fascinating and futuristic. Finally, in the process, it will have a positive impact on economic growth as it streamlines travel bottlenecks and also equips the government to access database of travellers for contract tracing and other investigations. 

## Demo Video

## Project Prototype
[Prototype Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/P5KugRilNUIPm34KCnlXDC/xlsol?node-id=2%3A6&scaling=scale-down)
We created our prototype using Figma: Prototyping Tool.
**User Guide** : 
This prototype will be visible as same as any Android application.
**If you are feeling difficulty in navigating through the screens.**
- Click somewhere on the screen you are stuck at !
- A blue box with selection will be visible.
- Click on that, to move on to the next or previous page.

The aim of this prototype is only for understanding the structure and architecture of the application.
It is not a production level or "ready-to-go" product.
